<h2>Website 1 Critique - Trader Joe's</h2>
<ol>
	<li>My first impression was that the site was a lot of fun. There were neat graphics, and a quality feel to it.</li>
	<li>The flow is orderly. The links are on the left usually, and have fun titles or convenient shopping suggestions.</li>
	<li>It makes sense, they have great use of graphics around links, and the lettering is done well so it doesn't feel difficult to navigate despite the unique style of the layout.</li>
	<li>The site may come across over-the-top to some, but I felt the graphics, media, and layout were fitting for Trader Joe's. The website has a very distinct style.</li>
	<li>The load time was fast, which I found surprising given the amount of content on the site.</li>
	<li>Very legible site, and the graphics certainly added to the website. The fun designs made me want to click on every link to see what whacky "drawing" would come up next.</li>
	<li>Yes, a very hard to miss, elegant navigation bar hangs on the left side of the page. The navigation was flawless, plenty of suggestions, and a nicely located search bar for if you know what you want.</li>
	<li>No, the colors and logos were apart of a cohesive color palette, and each page stood out in its own way.</li>
	<li>There was a great responsive design. When going to a smaller window everything remained center and legible...only smaller.</li>
	<li>Never knew that Trader Joe had podcast page, recipe page, and guides for how to make certain dishes. I thought that along with the personified animal graphics made it very well done.</li>

<h2>Website 2 Critique - Jami Lin</h2>
<ol>
	<li>I felt my computer was going to get a virus due to the cheaply done aesthetic. I found the site a little funny, nonetheless, from a business perspective I don't see how a site like that could build trust.</li>
	<li>The information has no flow at first. However, links seem to stay in the center-middle of the screen and towards the bottom. So I guess it has the structure of a bad infomercial turned into a website.</li>
	<li>The site structure is simple, but overwhelming. Every click opens a new tab into what looks like another website. The product themselves are confusing and nothing about them seems trustworthy.</li>
	<li>The graphics, layout, and multimedia certainly distract from the website. The placement gives the webpage a cluttered feel to it.</li>
	<li>The homepage loaded quick for me.</li>
	<li>The text on the links were basic, and didn't stand out much. However, the headers were poppy, "Galactic Spirit Quantum Seeker", is quite a title. The colors and contrasting were incompatible which distracted from the site.</li>
	<li>Yes, the site had a rainbow colored navigation bar that ran through the center of the page. The navigation bar was not good. Some of the tabs loaded slow, and one didn't load at all.</li>
	<li>Aside from the homepage, everything felt repeated after clicking on each of the links. This was not due to the color background of the tabs opened by the links, but their layout. There was an attempt to match the colored-link-block to the ensuing page, but even those colors didn't fully match.</li>
	<li>The site responds well in a smaller window. The site seems less gaudy seeing it in a smaller window.</li>
	<li>I'd say the site offers a very unusual esoteric branding. It was all around very tacky, but there was a positive message to some of the things marketed on there.</li>

<h2>Website 3 Critique - Sabletine</h2>
<ol>
	<li>The first impression that gravitated to me was the site's simplicity.</li>
	<li>The flow of information is directed to the center of the page. Links are cleanly found below the header, and above the general information of whatever part of the site your on.</li>
	<li>The site structure made sense. I liked the centering and margins of the site which drove attention straight to the context of the page.</li>
	<li>I felt the graphics enhanced the website. There wasn't any fat to the website, each page had one picture of the associated pastry or baked good which paired well with the simplicity of the site.</li>
	<li>The homepage had a reasonable loadtime, if there was any lag it wasn't perceivable to me.<li>
	<li>The text was on the finer end, but was legible. The colors were classy (aside from the bright pink catering link boxes) and there was a lot of white space which draws you into the substance of the page.</li>
	<li>Yes there was a navigation bar at the top under the bakery's name. The links in the navigation bar were clear to follow, but didn't take away from the information below so I'd say it was well done.</li>
	<li>The site is very uniform, but in a zen sort of way. It served the site well because it allowed for the pastry graphics to stand out giving each page a little a flare.</li>
	<li>The site did not have a very responsive design since the information was cut-off when moved into a smaller window.</li>
	<li>I felt the was well done due to the font choices and because of the tidiness the webpage implemented.</li>
</ol>
